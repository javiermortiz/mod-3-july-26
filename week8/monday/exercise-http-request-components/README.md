# Exercise: HTTP Request Components

Clone the exercise from the [starter].

Based on the following scenarios discuss and determine what the HTTP requests
components should be in each scenario.

For example, the request components for viewing the home page of Google could
include:

- method: GET
- URI: /home
- headers:
  - Host: google.com (OPTIONAL)
- body: none

> The `Host` header is optional is in this exercise.

The URI and body don't have to correct. Instead, make up your own URI or
description of the body contents that would make sense for the scenario.

2. Edit your Facebook comment
3. Upload your sick mixtape to SoundCloud
4. Submit an Amazon review for a product through an HTML form
5. Sell one of your stocks on Robinhood
