# Element Selection Practice

In this practice, you will be given an HTML document and an embedded JavaScript
file. Within the script file, there will be various elements or groups of
elements that are to be selected given to you.

Your job will be to write the selector queries that will return the indicated
element(s). Keep in mind there can be multiple ways to get the same result!
Results can be either NodeLists, HTMLCollections, Arrays, or individual
elements.

`console.log` your results and open the console to verify your results.
