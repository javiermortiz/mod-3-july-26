# Practice Creating and Removing Elements

In this practice, you will be given an HTML file with some interactive buttons
on the page. These buttons should trigger the page to display or remove images
from the page.

Your job will be to fill in the code in the given script file that these
buttons will trigger, namely, the code that removes and adds images to the
page.

Some code will be written for you, so all you'll need to do is fill in code
where indicated. An example image element along with CSS styles is provided to
serve as a guide for you.

To start, clone the [repository][repo].
