# Practice Adding and Removing Event Listeners

In this practice, you will be given a simple HTML page that needs some
interactive elements and behaviors added.

Your job will be to complete the following tasks, which will require you to
create the necessary event listeners and accompanying callback functions when
the events are triggered in `events.js`.

NOTE: `events.js` is imported in the `<head>` of `index.html`.

- When the DOM is loaded, alert the user that the DOM has loaded.
- When the `#red-input` input contains the word "red", change the background
  color of the input to red. Otherwise, remain transparent.
- When `#add-item` is pressed, a new `<li>` element with the value from
  `#list-add` is created and appended to the `<ul>`.
- When a new color is selected in `#color-select`, change the background color
  of the `<section>` it belongs to to that color.
- When `#remove-listeners` is clicked, all event listeners from the previous
  three sections should be removed.

If you complete these tasks early, here are some challenge tasks. Some may
require you to do further research into different event types.

- Create a button that re-adds the event listeners removed by the last task
  from `#part-4`.
- Create a new section that contains a `<div>` and a `hover` event that adds
  text to the `<div>` indicating that it is being hovered over.
- Create a global event listener that alerts the user whenever the space bar is
  pressed.
