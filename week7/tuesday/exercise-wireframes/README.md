# HTML Wireframe Practice

Wireframes are quick, lightweight outlines design specs that layout a web page.
Being able to discuss and plan your core elements allows your web page to have
a solid foundation to build on. This is an important skill when you work on
web design and development.

In this practice you will be identifying and discussing semantic HTML syntax from
an example wireframe.

Include what HTML elements you think each part in the
wireframe should be.

The wireframe should contain at least:

- Main Heading (h1)
- Subheading (h2)
- Main Image (img)
- Text paragraphs (p)
- Links (underlined blue text) (a)
- Lists (ul, ol, li)
- Sections (div)
- Social media icons (identify what tag a social media icon is)
