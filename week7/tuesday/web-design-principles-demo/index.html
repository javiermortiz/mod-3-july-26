    <h1>Web Design Principles Demo</h1>
    <p>As a designer, I’ve always believed that whitespace is THE fundamental building block of good design. When designers
    talk about whitespace, they actually mean negative space, the space between elements in a composition. It is the portion
    of the page left unmarked; the space between graphics, margins and gutters. It is the space between columns, between
    lines of type or figures that provides visual breathing room for the eye.</p>
    <p>Whitespace is an important element of design for good reason. If used well and correctly, it can transform a design and
    provide many advantages to your website. We need to deliver and develop layouts that are easy on the eyes and make
    people want to keep reading. It’s always important to remember that when we are designing for the web, our number one
    goal is to deliver a great product to our clients.</p>
    <h2>The Advantages of Using Whitespace</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p><strong>Increased Content Legibility:</strong> When users are on your site, they should be able to see where they are going and be given
        a reason to keep reading. Believe it or not, whitespace between paragraphs and around blocks of text and images actually
        helps people understand what they are reading and adds up to a better user experience overall.</p></li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Ability to Highlight Call to Actions (CTAs):</strong> At times, the most obvious way to make something stand out is to make things bigger. You can make images bigger or
            buttons bigger. However, surrounding the item with whitespace can be just as effective.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Creating Balance:</strong> oo little whitespace leads to confusion, disorganization and unreliability – qualities you don’t want associated with
            your site’s brand. On the other hand, too much whitespace could highlight a lack of content and a lack of user guidance.
            The key is to balance your designs and let whitespace act as a great tool to separate chunks of content for easy
            accessibility and improved user experience.</p>
