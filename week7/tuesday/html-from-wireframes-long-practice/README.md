# Week 7 HTML Project

Wireframes are the blueprints to every web page a developer creates. It is
important as a developer to be able to both identify and translate wireframes
from the design to semantic HTML syntax.

In this practice you will be identifying and creating semantic HTML syntax from
an example wireframe.

Your main focus is to pick the correct tags and syntax for
HTML attributes (src, href, target, etc).

The wireframe should contain at least:

- Top navigation bar
- Main Heading (h1)
- Subheading (h2)
- Main Image (img)
- Text paragraphs (p)
- Links (underlined blue text) (a)
- External links (underlined blue text with new-window icon)
  - add this code to the `<head>` of your HTML document:

  ```html
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons+Outlined" rel="stylesheet">
  ```
  - use this icon: https://material.io/resources/icons/?search=open%20in%20new&style=outline

- Footer: links to other articles
- Challenge: Identify any additional HTML attributes that may not listed
