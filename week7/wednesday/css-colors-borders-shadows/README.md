# Practice: CSS Colors, Borders, and Shadows

Now, it's time to practice your understanding of the
**CSS: Colors, Borders, and Shadows**.

You will begin with a web page that has all of the HTML and a little CSS
completed. You only need to add to the CSS to complete each phase.

## Phase 0 - Starter

Begin by downloading the [starter project]. Once you've unzipped and opened it
in VS Code, you can drag the __index.html__ file into your browser to view the
webpage, or use the **File Explorer** to open it in your browser. The only file
you will need to edit for this practice is __your-code.css__.

> Remember to save the CSS file and refresh the page in the browser whenever you
> make changes.

## Phase 1 - Borders

The first step is to add borders around two boxes. The first box with have
a border that is:

1. width of 5px
2. blue
3. solid

The second step box should be given a border that is:

1. dotted
2. red
3. width of 2px
4. rounded edges by 5px

## Phase 2 - Colors

Now, it's time to explore the `color` property.

First, change the `color` of the first text to `#FFC300`.
You can also try different hexidecimal color options to see how it affects
the text.

Next, use the rgb property to change the `color` of the second text.

Set the rgb of the text `color` to (214,122,127).

Finally, the boxes text will be easier to read with the set `background-color`.


## Phase 3 - Opacity and Shadows

Now, you can turn your attention the opacity of Box 3.

The first step is to change the `background-color` of the box using the rgba
properties. Change the opacity of the box to 0.6.

Afterwards, you can also manipulate the text's opacity by changing every h2's
opacity to 0.5 for additional practice.

Next, is to add box shadows to boxes 5 and 6.

Box 5 requires a box shadow with:

1. 8px beneath it
2. 2 px to the right
3. a blur-radius of 15px
4. a teal shadow

Box 6 requires a shadow with:

1. 5px to the right
2. 10px above
3. a color of `#800000`

Finally, you have learned how to manipulate common CSS properties to add special
features to your projects.
