# Practice: CSS Linking

Now, it's time to practice your understanding of the
**CSS: Linking**.

You will begin with a web page that has all of the HTML and a little CSS
completed. You only need to add to the CSS to complete each phase.

## Phase 0 - Starter

Begin by downloading the [starter project]. Once you've unzipped and opened it
in VS Code, you can drag the __index.html__ file into your browser to view the
webpage, or use the **File Explorer** to open it in your browser.

> Remember to save the CSS file and refresh the page in the browser whenever you
> make changes.

## Phase 1 - Link the CSS

The first step is to:

1. Link both the button.css file and the styles.css files to the index.html file
to add some color to this page!

OR

2. Create an import.css file. Use the @import keyword to import the styles.css
file and the button.css file. Then link the import.css file to your index.html.

It is good practice to try both to familarize yourself with either methods.

## What you've learned

Congratulations! You have successfully practiced how to link your CSS to your
HTML files.
